# Movies watch list

I like watching films and I'd like a way to keep track of which films I want to watch and which films I've already watched.

## Requirements:

- I should be able to run this software on my own laptop, so you must provide instructions on how to run it
- I should be able to add films to the watch list
- I should be able to mark that I've watched a film in the list
- I should be able to see all the films I've added to the watch list and there should be a way to distinguish whether or not I've watched each film
- I should be able to delete a film from the list
- When I run the app, I want it to suggest me a random film that's on my watch list
